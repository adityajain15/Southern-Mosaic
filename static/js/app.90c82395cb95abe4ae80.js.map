Lomax later taught English at Texas A&M University, researched and collected cowboy songs and, with Professor Leonidas Payne of the University of Texas at Austin, co-founded the Texas Folklore Society, a branch of the American Folklore Society. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Texas Folklore Society's founding members shared with Lomax a sense that their state's rich folklore needed to be documented and preserved for the analysis of later scholars. Nascent technology such as the radio and the gramophone, it was feared, would end the age-old tradition of transmitting music and lore directly from one person to the next. With professional musicians' works being piped into homes across the country, the purity of traditional music and its particularities of region, religion and ethnicity, could be lost forever.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Circumstances took John Lomax away from his beloved Texas in 1917, when he accepted a job as a banker in Chicago. When his wife, Bess Brown Lomax, died in 1931, a full-scale return to folklore studies, as a lecturer and folk song researcher, gradually revived the despondent John Lomax. The Macmillan publishing company accepted his proposal for an all-inclusive anthology of American ballads and folk songs, and in the summer of 1932 he traveled to Washington D.C. to do research in the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress.\n    </p>\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"JL_Portrait.jpg\" caption='John Avery Lomax (Alan Lomax Collection AFC 2004/004)'></ImageAndCaption>\n    <p>\n      By the time of Lomax's visit, the archive already contained a collection of commercial phonograph recordings and wax cylinder field recordings of folk songs. Lomax made an arrangement with the Library whereby it would provide recording equipment (including recording blanks), in exchange for which he would travel the country recording songs to be added to the archive. Thus began a 10-year relationship with the Library that would involve not only John but the entire Lomax family.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Thanks to a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, Lomax was able to set out in June 1933 on his first recording expedition under the Library's auspices, with his 18-year old son Alan. John and Alan toured Southern prison farms recording work songs, reels, ballads and blues from prisoners, whom they believed represented an isolated musical culture \"untouched\" by the modern world.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Throughout that summer, as John Lomax traveled across the South, pursuing his lifelong interests, he courted Ruby Terrill by mail. They were married on July 21, 1934, in Commerce, Texas.\n    </p>\n    <hr />\n      <p>\n        Ruby Terrill, called \"Miss Terrill\" by John Lomax even after their wedding, first met her future husband in 1921. A native Texan, she was dean of women and instructor of classical languages at East Texas State Teachers College in Commerce, Texas, when John Lomax lectured there on his cowboy song research. After she gave him and his young son, Alan, a tour of Commerce, he enlisted her as a babysitter. More than a decade later, the widowed John Lomax reintroduced himself to Miss Terrill, now a classical languages M.A. from Columbia University; co-founder of the pioneering woman educator's professional society, the Delta Kappa Gamma Society International; dean of women at the University of Texas at Austin; and Alan Lomax's Latin instructor.\n      </p>\n      <ImageAndCaption source=\"ruby.jpg\" caption='Ruby Terrill Lomax (Alan Lomax Collection AFC 2004/004)'></ImageAndCaption>\n      <p>\n        His newlywed status did not prevent John Lomax from continuing to make disc recordings of musicians throughout the South. Meanwhile, Ruby Terrill Lomax continued working at the university, overseeing the home and family and taking care of a number of duties for her husband's research. In 1937 she decided to exchange the academic pursuits and frenetic schedule of her life in Austin for the intellectual pursuits and equally frenetic pace of life on the road with a ballad hunter. The Lomaxes made a house outside Dallas (called the \"House in the Woods\") their permanent residence, then drove away in Ruby's Plymouth on a scouting tour of the Southern states. The classics scholar evidently enjoyed the expedition, and threw herself wholeheartedly into it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Ruby Terrill Lomax's role in the success of the 1939 Southern States Recording Trip cannot be overemphasized. She composed nearly all written documentation relating to the collection. She cataloged the contents of each disc on the record's dust jacket as the recording was taking place. According to Frank Goodwyn, a ranch hand who sang cowboy songs for the Lomaxes in April 1939, Miss Terrill operated the Presto machine while John instructed and encouraged the performers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        After the trip, at the Library of Congress she transcribed song lyrics and composed and typed much of the 307 pages of field notes. In addition, Ruby's voice can be heard on a number of the recordings, carefully announcing the performer's name and the date and location of the recording. While her husband possessed the expert knowledge of the material he was seeking and collecting, Ruby Lomax possessed the organizational and archival skills of a longtime administrator and instructor, the wide-eyed wonder of a lifelong learner uncovering a whole new world of studies and the social skills of a parliamentarian who was a key player on many teams.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In 1940, when the couple traversed the same path through the South, she took on the additional role of photographer. Many photographs from the 1940 recording expedition accompany this piece.\n      </p>\n    <hr />\n    <h2>Visualizing the journey</h2>\n    <p id=\"mapExplainer\">John and Ruby Lomax travelled for 6,502 miles in their journey, across 10 different states in 3 months.

At Aransas\n      Pass, on the mainland, we unboxed and loaded into our Plymouth the fine almost-new\n      recording machine, microphone, stand and converter, leaving the two heavy batteries to\n      be shipped directly to Houston by express.

The engagement that set the date for this trip was a performance of a Sacred Drama, The Good Thief, about which Sister Joan of Arc of the Our Lady of the Lake College had written to the Lomaxes. It was to be presented on Easter Sunday, April 9, at Guadalupe Church, Houston, by a group of Mexican Texans led by the Gozalo Lopez Family of Sugarland. Unfortunately after two of the choruses had been recorded <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02600b2.wav\" text=\"the batteries failed\"></SoundText>; they visited the López family at their home in Sugar Land two weeks later to capture the entire drama.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Some of the first recordings made on the trip are by John B. Jones, a former student of John Lomax at the Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College. While at college Jones had became interested in folk songs and was helpful in bringing in folk materials. This was an interest he had kept. At Jones’ home in Houston, on April 10, John Lomax recorded old tunes with words, including a ‘Bawdy song’ <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02589a2.wav\" text=\"The British King\"></SoundText>, that Jones had learned from various sources. His mother, Mrs. Kate W. Jones, who had come to Texas from Mississippi in 1868, also knew and recorded several fragments, mostly children's songs such as <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02590a4.wav\" text=\"All Those Pretty Little Horses\"></SoundText>.\n    </p>\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"00318v.jpg\" caption='Woman sitting in car, Texas\n' link=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/lomax/item/2007660045/\"></ImageAndCaption>\n    <p>\n      On April 12, 1939, the Lomaxes recorded John Lowry Goree who was educated at Judson College; his great-grandfather, a trustee of that college and plantation owner, gave his children the plantation. Mr. Goree’s mother died when he was born; as a small child he had Scrofula and was sent to the plantation to be nursed by an old ‘mammy’, Aunt Harriet and he lived in a log cabin with her for two years. From her he learned the lullabies, such as <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02592b1.wav\" text=\"Who Curled Your Hair\"></SoundText>, by which he was often sung to sleep. Furthermore he sang his own children to sleep by them.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One particular recording made by Goree, <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02591a1.wav\" text=\"Negro Prayer About 4-Cent Cotton\"/>, stands out. It contains one of the few textual references to the Great Depression in the 1939 Southern Recording Trip. The recording obliquely or directly references practices such as tenant farming and sharecropping, the New Deal, the crash of 1929, as well as the Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      \"Yon comes Bre'r Zeke; he ain' much on preachin', but he's 'bout de out-prayin'est Parson dat ever went to town on Satday … back in 1932, Bre'r Zeke walked out to de aidge o' de pulpit 'n' rolled his eyes up to de sky, 'n' stretched his arms straight out in frontta him, 'n' start prayin': … Now, Oh-o Marster, Thou seeth me in dese days o' 'versity; Oh-o Marster, Thou seeth me gwine upn' down de cotton fiel', tryin', Oh-o Marster, tryin' by de sweater my brow ter feed six chilluns wid some fo' cent cotton.

A group of ditch-diggers was working in time to the musical calls of the leader. We arranged to return to make records on the next day, Sunday, and returned to West Columbia to rent batteries for power, the dormitory being wired for DC current.\n      <span><a href=\"http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/jp2.py?data=/service/afc/afc1939001/afc1939001_fn0001/0032.jp2&res=1\" target=\"blank\">1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes</a></span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When the Lomaxes arrived at Clemens State Farm on April 16th, after John Lomax had made some suggestions as to what kind of music he wished to record, musicians and singers volunteered or were pushed forward by their companions. Some people such as Ace Johnson and Smith Cason already had had experience before the microphone, since they were sometimes on a program called “Behind the Walls”, broadcast from the Huntsville, Texas Penitentiary on Wednesday nights. After two hours the Lomaxes stopped for lunch, they being served with the white guards, and after lunch they recorded for an hour or so until the time came for “base-ball practice and preaching services”.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      Work songs were used by African American railroad work crews in the southern United States before modern machinery became available in the 1960s. Anne Kimzey of the Alabama Center For Traditional Culture writes: “All-black gandy dancer crews used songs and chants as tools to help accomplish specific tasks and to send coded messages to each other so as not to be understood by the foreman and others. The lead singer, or caller, would chant to his crew, for example, to realign a rail to a certain position. His purpose was to uplift his crew, both physically and emotionally, while seeing to the coordination of the work at hand. It took a skilled, sensitive caller to raise the right chant to fit the task at hand and the mood of the men. Using tonal boundaries and melodic style typical of the blues, each caller had his own signature. The effectiveness of a caller to move his men has been likened to how a preacher can move a congregation.”\n      <span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_song#African-American_work_songs\" target=\"blank\">Wikipedia</a></span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The recordings made at Clemens State Farm comprise mostly of the Blues and work songs. The recordings include a poignant work song titled <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_03551b2.wav\" text=\"Old Hannah\"></SoundText> that addresses the Sun and asks that it “rise no more”. Alan Lomax later remarked that ‘Old Hannah’ is “the American Volga Boatmen”. Other notable songs include the ‘Disaster Ballad’ <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_03552b3.wav\" text=\"Influenza\"></SoundText>  \n    </p>\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"00288v.jpg\" caption='Prisoner in camp hospital, Darrington State Farm, Texas' link=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/lomax/item/2007660014/\"></ImageAndCaption>\n    <p>\n      The Lomax also made a fruitless trip to the Central State Farm near Sugarland, Texas. On previous occasions the Lomaxes had acquired material that they were looking for but this time they found that “The old crowd had scattered, the new boys sang fewer of the old songs and in performance imitated radio artists. We did not set up the machine.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Lomaxes proceeded on to Camp Four of the Ramsey State Farm. With the help of the Captain and some of his guards they located some singers, who were admitted one by one or by small groups into a small office where the recording machine was set up. One of these groups included Columbus Christopher, Alexander Hamilton and George Washington, who sang for them under guard, behind three sets of locks.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      It was customary to set down nicknames of singers along with their names, which caused some embarrassment at Ramsey. In routine manner, “What is your name?” asked Mrs. Lomax of one of the singers. He gave it readily. “Your nickname?” No reply, just a shuffling of feet. “Haven't you a nickname?” Again a shuffling of feet, and then hesitatingly: “Dey calls me Monkey.” A swift glance at the boy's features stopped the usual “How did you get that nickname?” Mrs. Lomax changed to an embarrassed and especially cordial “Thank you.” Supper with the white guards closed our day at Ramsey. <span><a href=\"http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/jp2.py?data=/service/afc/afc1939001/afc1939001_fn0001/0049.jp2&res=1\" target=\"blank\">1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes</a></span>\n    </p>\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"00283v.jpg\" caption='James Baker (Iron Head), head-and-shoulders portrait, facing right, Sugar Land, Texas' link=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/lomax/item/2007660009/\"></ImageAndCaption>\n    <p>\n      At Ramsey, the Lomaxes also located James “Iron Head” Baker, who had previously made many recordings for them and had also toured with John Lomax on a recording trip through the South. The field-notes report that Baker was initially reluctant to come forward for he was ashamed that John Lomax, who had successfully petitioned for his parole in the past, would find him in worse case. Finally, he interrupted a group that was singing a popular music-hall ditty and said “No he don't\nwant that kind o' stuff. This is kindly what he's after”, and he started singing an old-time spiritual. Baker then recorded spirituals such as <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02604b3.wav\" text=\"Will You March Down\"></SoundText> and <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02604b2.wav\" text=\"This Heart o' Mine\"></SoundText>  \n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      Iron Head claims his nickname from this story: One day when he was cutting timber, a big tree caught him and one of its largest limbs struck him down across the head.

It had occurred to some one of the family, Lorenza Lopez, some fifty years ago that the drama would be more effective if the lyrical parts were sung. Lorenza Lopez approached an old school teacher in Coahuila, Lorenzo Flores, who after praying over the matter for several days, set the verses to tunes which he taught the Lopez family. The tunes were handed down from generation to generation of the Lopez family without written music.\n      </p> \n    <hr />\n    <BarChart state=\"Texas\"></BarChart>\n    <hr/>\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"key.png\"></ImageAndCaption>\n    <Bloom :data=\"theData\" state=\"Texas\"></Bloom>\n    <hr />\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"00276r.jpg\" caption='Mexican girls, San Antonio, Texas' link=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/lomax/item/2007660002/\"></ImageAndCaption>\n    <p>\n      The Lomaxes were introduced to Manuela Longoria, the principal of a suburban grade school of pupils from Mexican families.

The recording at Blalack School was made in a large classroom, the children sitting around the machine on the floor, watching every move of singers and recorders.

Suarez, who walked with the aid of a cane, had a wide repertoire of Mexican and Spanish songs and tunes which he recorded for the Lomaxes. One song that particularly stands out is <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02611a1.wav\" text=\"Yo cuando era niño - mi padre querido\"></SoundText> that tells the story of the vagrant Mexican cotton pickers. \n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      Prior to 1904, the date of the first railroad in this part of the country, there was a general exodus of Mexicans picking cotton from Brownsville to Mississippi and beyond.

In 1939 he was a student at the College of Arts and Industries at Kingsville, Texas interested in the study of English literature, in music and how to write English compositions. A professor of English at the college told the Lomaxes about Goodwyn.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Goodwyn learned many of his songs from his mother and from Blind Eddie, a fiddler who used to hang around Goodwyn’s uncle’s country store.

He refused even to repeat or to write out the words of such a lowly ballad, but finally Goodwyn, taking him aside, persuaded Lopez to whisper the words to him, and in trying to recall the words in spots he hummed the tune two or three times. This was sufficient for Goodwyn’s quick ear and retentive memory; from this humming he caught the tune, practiced the song with his guitar over night, and sang the ballad <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02621a1.wav\" text=\"Don Benefacio e Don Coy\" /> into the microphone the next day.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Another notable recording made by Salinas and Lopez is <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02618a2.wav\" text=\"Versos del mojado\"/>, a ballad that speaks of the trials of a “Wet-back” who has come across the Rio Grande River into the United States without required credentials.

His <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_03802a1.wav\" text=\"Rye Whiskey\"/>, known in some parts as Drunken Hiccups, was famous in the “Hill Country” of Texas.

Mansell’s most notable recording is <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02638b1.wav\" text=\"All the Pretty Little Horses\"/>, a classic southern lullaby, for which she herself wrote the following note\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      All the Pretty Little Horses is a family song. There is not a time when I do not remember it. I am sure it was Grandmother Brown’s song; from our mother it now belongs to her four children. Grandmother did not often sing anything but hymns, and those mostly on Sunday afternoons when she rocked back and forth in her little straight, cane-bottomed rocker, alone in her room. Grandmother did not believe that on Sunday people should do anything but attend Sunday School, then church, then read the Bible until time to go to evening services. Her disapproval of our Sunday afternoon walks, when the children from all the neighborhood gathered to explore the woods, or “walk through to the Dam”, caused her to shut herself into her room and rock and sing, and I am sure, pray for forgiveness for us all. Her lips would shut into a thin line, and her eyes fill with tears. <br><br>\n\n      But Grandmother Brown loved babies, and she sang to us all, and rocked us, hours and hours, in that same little chair. All the Pretty Little Horses is a wonderful lullaby. The phrases can be changed, a line or two of hums can be put in at will instead of the words, and the baby drifts off into sleep, floating with the little horses the song blends with the squeak of the rocker and the pat of the foot on the rug. The horrible verse about the “bees and the butterflies” was not sung in our house, and should never be used—what baby could sleep with such a pitiful and ghastly picture stamped into his dreamy little soul? I still sing it to my girls when they are ill, but they always request that that verse not be sung. And I don’t blame them.<span><a href=\"http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/jp2.py?data=/service/afc/afc1939001/afc1939001_fn0001/0127.jp2&res=1\" target=\"blank\">1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes</a></span>\n    </p>\n    <hr />\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"00285v.jpg\" caption='Moses Platt (Clear Rock) Sugar Land, Texas\n' link=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/lomax/item/2007660011/\"></ImageAndCaption> \n    <p>\n      On a May evening, John Lomax stopped the Plymouth on the outskirts of Taylor, Texas and enquired of some African-Americans, who were sitting on their cabin stoop, whether they knew “Clear Rock” who had been released recently from the state penitentiary. They did not know “Clear Rock” but Lomax's description fit one called “Wyandotte” who usually hung around a barber shop on the other side of the railroad. Someone confirmed the belief that Clear Rock and Winedot were one and the same person, namely Moses Platt.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      And so the search was on: on the promise of a dime a boy conducted us to Clear Rock's home, only to hear from neighors that Clear Rock and his wife had been seen going up the tracks towards town just ten minutes ago; twenty-five cents was to be the reward for bringing him to our hotel. No word had come by breakfast time, and so Mr. Lomax started out afoot in earch. When he returned to the hotel two hours later, there he found Clear Rock, sitting on the running board of the Lomax automobile; with him was his two-hundred-fifty pound wife, his “seventeen wife,” as he told Mrs. Lomax later. They had been waiting at the car from six o'clock. The wife, looming too large for our small hotel room, was dismissed with breakfast. <span><a href=\"http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/jp2.py?data=/service/afc/afc1939001/afc1939001_fn0001/0132.jp2&res=1\" target=\"blank\">1939 Southern Recording Trip Fieldnotes</a></span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Platt himself was ready and willing to do anything the “boss” asked, except to stop talking. To unwind him somewhat, John Lomax let him record some stories first. The two had met previously at Central State Farm, wherein John and Alan Lomax made some recordings, and Lomax wished to re-record some of his best songs with the improved machine. At first Platt was slow at entering into the spirit of the old work-songs, “disremembering” the words of some of them, because perhaps of two circumstances: Platt was now “The Reverend Moses Platt,” devoted to hymns and spirituals, and what secular songs he indulged in were mostly modern jazz, sung for the entertainment of his white friends. After some cajoling words and a substantial contribution to the next Sabbath’s collection, Platt overcame his handicaps, and for four hours he told stories and sang and preached and prayed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Notable recordings by Platt include <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02643b2.wav\" text=\"Black Betty\"/> a song that entered American pop culture when it was covered by the band ‘Ram Jam’ in 1977. The identity of ‘Black Betty’ is open to debate. According to Platt, “Black Betty was a old n***** woman right outa Goree”, Goree being the name of a state farm for women.  \n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      Historically the “Black Betty” of the title may refer to the nickname given to a number of objects: a musket, a bottle of whiskey, a whip, or a penitentiary transfer wagon.\n      <span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Betty#Meaning_and_origin\" target=\"blank\">Wikipedia</a></span>\n    </p>\n    <hr />\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"1470066081.jpg\" caption='A group of singers from the Goree Unit at the Texas Prison Rodeo (Source: Texas Department of Criminal Justice)'></ImageAndCaption> \n   <p>\n    On May 12, John Lomax visited the State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.

He and his family had just returned from the funeral of his wife's sister-in-law, her brother's wife who had left a tiny baby girl for the Truvillions to “tend”. There had been sleepless nights of sitting up, with the sick woman and then with her lifeless body, and everybody was exhausted further by the long exciting funeral service.

Truvillion thought that East Texas lumber may have played out some day, and so he had “bought a little place to work and lay something by.” He had a neat white house of four rooms, comfortably furnished, and he and the children cultivated a vegetable garden, flowers in the front yard and an orchard. Cotton, corn and peanuts were his best crops. He also kept a good cow and raised pigs and chickens.

His loud chords topped by loud, husky singing, made an interesting combination, but one difficult to record.

In the few days that they were working around Livingston she drove her car nearly two hundred miles, looking up singers, and bringing them to the microphone, from far and near, over hill, over dale, through mud and stream. Tartt had the confidence of the community including the African-Americans whom she never refused help.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Doc Reed and Vera Hall, cousins who had sung together for many years, were Tartt’s dependables and good singers of the old style spirituals, perfect in “seconding”- “following after” they called it,- and they knew many songs. Not having book-learning they stored in the back of their heads innumerable tunes and stanzas, and if they do not understand completely the text, they are ingenious in supplying substitutes either from other spirituals or from their own feelings of the moment. They, however, did not substitute jargon; their texts meant something, if not always what the original words meant. Few of the substantial number of recordings the both made include <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_03555b1.wav\" text=\"Job, Job'\"/>, <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02687b1.wav\" text=\"Climbin' up de Hill o' Mt.

If she heard a song sung through once or twice, she could sing it again herself, with a variation or two of her own, always an improvement. This time the Lomaxes asked her for playparty or game or other children's songs. “It's been a long time” she hesitated. Then she smiled, “We used to sing <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02687b2.wav\" text=\"All hid?\"/>. May be I can put it together.” Looking about her as if she thought that Mrs. Tartt's yard would be a very good place to find hiding-places, she started off. With this song her mind had slipped back into its play groove, and Vera, at this one sitting, gave the Lomaxes five more children's songs: <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02680a3.wav\" text=\"Come up, Horsey\"/>, <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02678b2.wav\" text=\"Rosey\"/>, <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02684a2.wav\" text=\"Carrie\"/>, <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02684b1.wav\" text=\"Little girl, yes ma'am\"/>, <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02684b2.wav\" text=\"Candy gal\"/>, and <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02684b3.wav\" text=\"Hold the Gates\"/>\n    </p>\n    <hr/>\n    <p>\n      It was Sunday, May 29, 1939 and the Lomaxes had started out to Doc Reed's church for services. Mrs. Tartt suggested that they all stop at Aunt Caroline Horne’s house off in the cotton patch a half mile or so from the road. There we found Hornse, two daughters, Frances and Aurilla, a son, Jim (Duck), some other friends of the family and a bunch of “grands”. It was a giggly group, the boys given to wise-cracking. It started raining at about this time and the Lomaxes setup their machine and batteries on the porch. Finally one of the daughters suggested a church song, <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02688b2.wav\" text=\"I Got to Stand There by Myself\"/>, which she and her mother sang. Then the two daughters recorded another spiritual <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02688b3.wav\" text=\"All My Sins Been Taken Away\"/>. Aunt Caroline recalled and sang the children’s song <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02688a3.wav\" text=\"Little Red Bird in the tree\"/>. The Lomaxes, feeling they had overstayed their time, recorded a couple other songs and left after the rain had “let up a bit”.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It started raining heavily again, however, as they made their way to the church to which they had started. Mrs. Tartt, driving ahead of the Lomaxes to show them the way, would not turn back even though they passed two cars in the ditch, until at the top of another long red-clay hill where the road curved at the top, her car not only took the curve but made a complete circle and stood facing homeward. Then at last she consented to go back. On their way back they stopped at the Johnson Place Baptist Church in which they found the preacher holding forth on Moses. After about fifteen minutes he said, “I can't fool around with Moses all day, I must pass on to Jesus.” When he stopped at two-thirty the Lomaxes set up their machine and caught some “mournin” songs such as <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02694b1.wav\" text=\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\"/>. \n    </p>\n    <ImageAndCaption source=\"38814v.jpg\" caption=\"Aunt Harriett McClintock at the microphone with John A.

When she went to interview him she found him very drunk. He had the reputation of being a hard worker during the week and a hard drinker at week ends and could do nothing that day but promised to come into town to Mrs. Tartts's home the next day. Indeed, the next day up strolled Jeff. “It was hard work”, he asserted, “to keep my word, but I wrastled wid it an' got it to come thro”. With him were two friends, Ben Donner and Robert Chapman, each of whom sang a song.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The same day the Lomaxes recorded <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02696a1.wav\" text=\"Give Me a Gourd o' Cold Water\"/> from Aunt Florida, who after singin' spirituals started on a “reel”, but, breaking off in the middle, began to explain how she could not go on in “sech sin” \n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      “I told de Lord that I wouldn't sin no more.

She said that she had heard the group sing together with beautiful effect, and she believed that because of the rain they would not be working in the field so she drove the seventeen miles or more to their farm home to bring them back into her home to sing. She was told at their house that “Sim an' them is huntin' fish”. Mrs. Tartt walked through the mud down to the river, calling as she went, to locate them. Finally she heard a startled whisper, “Dat's Miss Ruby Callin'! Hear her? Reckin what she want?” Then Mrs. Tartt, “Sim, Mandy, you heard me. Where are you?” They came forth, bare-footed and thinly clad for they really had been fish-hunting. The high water, receding, had left live fish far up on the bank and they were spearing and catching them with their bare hands. But at Mrs. Tartt’s bidding, they left the river, hastily made themselves reddy and were on their way.

The Lomaxes listened to the “hollerin”' though they thought it was too harsh a word for such rounded-tones. Enoch Brown was crossing the bridge over the Sacarnatchie that ran at the foot of Baldwin Hill, and was artist enough to know that from just there his calls would sound most effective. It was a sort of “hallo-ing”, demonstrated on <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02685b2.wav\" text=\"Levee Holler\"/>,perhaps a form of yodeling though the words were those of field songs, with always a weird lonesomeness that the Lomaxes could never quite get the effect of into their microphone.

His laugh, too, is not of this earth. Enoch's clothing consist mostly of rags pinned together; he does not keep himself clean; he works only when he is hungry, and not then if he has some excuse to walk up the hill to Mra. Tartt's home about mealtime.

Mrs. Griffin was almost blind; she kept one of her grandchildren to help her, and she had a boarder, a workman who took his lunch with him. After they had talked with her a little while and she had sung three or four songs, inluding <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02705b2.wav\" text=\"The Cambric Shirt\"/> a variation of which was made popular by Simon and Garfunkel. Mrs. Griffin invited the Lomaxes to dinner; there was no excusing themselves, and they stayed. The food was coarse and poorly prepared, but Mrs. Griffin's courteous hospitality made up for any deficiencies in the quality of the food. She had chickens, all of whom she called by name, and the Lomaxes recorded her <SoundText audioUrl=\"./static/audio_files/afc1939001_02698a3.wav\" text=\"Calling Chickens\"/>.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n      She calls herself a Georgy Cracker. “How did you happen to leave Georgia, Mrs. Griffin?” “Well, my Ma had a sister down here she wanted to see, so her an' five o' us kids jes' come. We lef' Pa at home an' he come later.” “How did you come?” “Walked hit. A hundred ‘n’ seventy eight miles, ever step of hit. Tuck us three weeks. But when we wuz bigger me an' my brother walked hit agin in seven days an' nights”. She had twelve children all brought to maturity and eleven of them living now. “my children all had the same father. I haint never been that way except fer one man, an' as the Lord's my witness I haint never knowed but two men in all my life, an' them two wuz my husbands. An' I've been thowed with men in every way. I've worked in the fields with 'em, rid horse races with 'em-why I run a horse race right over thar, ridin' barback, made some money too, not bettin', but jest the prize money; an' I've built a house with my own hands, an' when I married Mr. Griffin I wuz runnin' a sawmill o' my own, an' had twelve men a workin' for me.” Explaining that she was not on good terms with one of her daughters who probably could remember some of the song words that she had forgot, Mrs. Griffin said: “Will Brown, he's my daughter's husband, told me he'd kick me off the place if I ever come near his house. An' d'ye know why? Well, I told 'em plain out that Nellie, that's their daughter an' my own grandchild, too, I haint a-denyin' that, but I told 'em she wuz goin' to burn in hell fire fer breaking up another man's home. She went in an' got a man to fall in love with her, then she tuck an' divorced her own husband an' made this other man divorce his wife an' then they wuz married. Twarnt nothin' but plain adultery an' nothin' caint save her from hell, an' I told ‘em so an’ they don't like hit.” “Anyhow my daughter caint sing any better than I can, fer she's snaggled toothed too.” <br><br>\n      Mrs. Griffin used to work large farm, but once had $22000 in bank. Lost most of it in bank failure. Mrs. Griffin calls a spade a spade. She can't write, “never went to school a day in my life”. This came out when she complained that she had difficulty in shopping: “I have to send my grandson here, an' he caint remember but one thing at a time; so I have to send him fer meat, an' then when he gits home with the meat, I have to send him back for beans.” “Why dont you write out a list for the grocer?” Then came the explanation. But Mrs. Griffin is wise in many ways beyond “book-larnin'”.

The men were good-natured about it, and when the singers moved, the whole group made no complaint at having to move too. When a singer would say, \"This is as clost as I kin git to the mike\", the other men would shuffle their leg-chains along the big chain until the singer could reach the mike. This was in group singing, where the mike could not be moved to one singer. Robertson and a young reporter who was with the Lomaxes did not know that such a custom existed in South Carolina and they immediately made resolutions. John Lomax later wrote to the Governor of South Carolina\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"quotationBlock\">\n    My dear Governor<br><br>Since 1934 I have spent much of my time travelling throughout the south making records of folk songs. In this work I have visited Negro convicts in all Southern penitentiaries, and in many of the road camps. In making my reports to the Library of Congress I have found so much unjust criticism and misinformation about the treatment of Negro convicts in the South that a year or so ago I wrote a news article explaining the widely misunderstood term “chain gang”. In this story I stated that I had never soon convicts chained together. (As a matter of fact no instance of physical brutality in all my experiences have come under my personal notice). I can no longer make this claim.<br><br>A few Sundays ago I visited the convict road camp in Anderson County, South Carolina, near Clemson College. There I saw a hundred negroes resting in their quarters, all fastened togother on a single long chain, so that when a small group agreed to sing for me, the entire bunch had to move out of the tent and stand in the open.<br><br>I do not know of the special reasons that make it necessary for these men to be chained together on their rest day. I only know that I have never before seen a practice which seemed to me unnecessary and inhuman.<br><br>I am writing to you, Governor, only in the hope that, through the power of your office and the high esteem in which you are held by your people, you can have this situation corrected.

When they arrived some fifty people of all ages had gathered. The house was dimly lighted but the Lomaxes set to work as quickly as possible, since lightning was beginning to flash. Perhaps the congregation did not feel at home, but response came slowly.

It was a hot day and the building of the main session was steaming, literally. Loud speakers made the singing audible over several acres. It was a great social gathering, a veritable reunion and so it was impossible to choose wisely. After listening for a long time on the outside, John Lomax chose two quartets, one of women, one of men, for recordings. They were conducted to a building where the machine was set up.

The lead singer, or caller, would chant to his crew, for example, to realign a rail to a certain position. His purpose was to uplift his crew, both physically and emotionally, while seeing to the coordination of the work at hand. It took a skilled, sensitive caller to raise the right chant to fit the task at hand and the mood of the men. Using tonal boundaries and melodic style typical of the blues, each caller had his own signature.
